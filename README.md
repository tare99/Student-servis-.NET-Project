# Student servis C# .NET Project

A simple student service where you can store and edit student's data, their roles and passed subjects.
Technologies that I've used to create it: C#, .NET Framework 4.7.2 with Entity Framework 6, SQLite libraries and Microsoft Reporting Services and SQLite as database.
